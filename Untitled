Hi Jonathan,

Here are the instructions for today's second coding challenge. We'll use screen sharing for this, so you can work on your computer, using whatever IDE/tool stack you'd like to, but I'll need to see what you're working on.

1. Create a basic Angular 6 app locally using the IDE of your choice, launch in broswer
2. On application launch, consume the following REST API endpoint and load a list of apartment advertisements: https://api.mcmakler.de/v1/advertisements
3. Display the first 10 advertisements on the page, using a layout similar to the attached screenshot. Make some effort to add some styling to it, but don't spend too much time on it

4. Bonus: add a dropdown control to change the sorting order of the list by at least 3 of the visible fields
5. Bonus: add unit tests for the services/components you create

Relevant fields from JSON:

- Top right corder: hasFurniture (furnished/unfurnished)
- Image: advertisementAssets > advertisementThumbnails > inventory_m > url (titlePicture needs to be set to true)
- Bold text: title
- Sub text: realestateSummary > address > number, street / city
- Price: advertisementPrice > baseRent
- Bottom right corder: realestateSummary > numberOfRooms | realestateSummary > space

I'll call you shortly.
